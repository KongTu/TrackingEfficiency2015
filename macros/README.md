plot tracking efficiency, fake rates, secondary rates, multiple reconstruction rates, as function of eta and pT with overall centrality.

- plotHist3D.C

plot tracking efficiency, fake rates, secondary rates, multiple reconstruction rates, as function of eta and pT with fixed pT and eta range respectively but different centrality.
